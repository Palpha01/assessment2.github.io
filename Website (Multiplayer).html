        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>When players first log into the game, they are asked to pick a faction to represent. This is not a permanent
            choice as players can change factions at any time, but as a season progresses, a player changing factions
            will receive diminished rewards. This is to discourage players from changing to a winning side during a
            season. Players can play any unlocked hero from any faction, but all multiplayer activity will count only
            towards the faction they chose.</p>

        <h3>Faction Wars</h3>

        <p>A full season of multiplayer faction vs faction (multiplayer) gameplay takes a total of 10 weeks. Every 6
            hours, factions will have an opportunity to gain territory. Gains are then tallied and added to an overall
            rank for that faction. After the season is over, players of the dominant faction will have opportunities to
            receive additional rewards.</p>

        <p>The overall map is divided into multiple regions. Dominated territories will be displayed with the faction
            color. Knights are yellow, Samurai is teal blue and Vikings are red. A colored bar is displayed above the
            region showing the current fight status, This is updated on the servers every 7 minutes. A wider bar color
            shows the faction currently dominant over the faction(s) with the smaller bar. Crossed swords above the bar
            represent the region as currently contested.</p>

        <p>At the end of each match, players are rewarded XP and a currency called Steel. These can be used to unlock
            new combat abilities and new visual customization options. They also have a chance to loot armor and weapon
            parts on the battlefield with specific stats allowing each player to adapt their gear to their playstyle
            while ensuring fairness and balance in multiplayer. They will also receive War Assets that can be deployed
            on the map. Players who do not deploy their War Assets themselves will have them automatically placed by the
            game. Placed War Assets are a benefit to the faction and are not meant to be hoarded or ignored.</p>

            <h3>Game Modes</h3>

            <div class="classlist">
                <li>Dominion
                    <dl>Dominion mode is a 4v4 PVP map that allows players to battle against each other. There are three
                        strategic control zones on this map. The goal is to control as much of the map as possible and
                        gain points. Once points have gone over 1k, respawn is no longer allowed and it is a fight to
                        the death.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Duel
                    <dl>This 1v1 mode puts two Heroes face-to-face in a fight to the death. Skill is fundamental in Duel
                        of course, but as in Brawl, players have the possibility to use the environment to their
                        advantage.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Brawl
                    <dl>2v2 mode in which each team of two players will need to kill the two enemy Heroes to win a
                        round. Skill, awareness, cooperation and the capacity to use the environment to the player's
                        advantage are key components.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Elimination
                    <dl>In this 4v4 mode, the last surviving player on the battlefield wins the round for their team.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Skirmish
                    <dl>This is a 4v4 Team Death Match like mode. Combat skills are key in this mode as players score
                        points for their team by killing enemy Heroes.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Breach
                    <dl>A full castle siege is underway. Attackers and their forces must guide the battering ram, breach
                        the castle through phases and kill the Commander while the defenders must stop them.</dl>
                </li>
