        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div class="classimg"><img src="C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\For Honor\Heavies.png" alt="Heavies"
                width="900" height="400" /></div>

        <p>The Heavy is one of four playable types of Heroes in For Honor. Easy to identify by either their robust build
            or a noticeable tool of defense, these Heroes sport high resistance and defensive options.</p>

        <p>These beefy warriors hold the highest raw survivability compared to the other three types of Heroes (the
            Hybrids, the Assassins, and the Vanguards), some of them notably able to deliver devastating damage in a
            single hit. However, because they are not as mobile, they are typically tasked with working with the team to
            hold positions until reinforcements arrive. A well-trained Heavy will remain patient, relying on their
            defensive abilities to resist incoming attacks and wait for their opportunity to strike back with slow but
            extremely strong blows.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>The most resilient to damage of all types. With a strong defense and a larger health pool than other Heroes,
            the Heavy swings slow but hard. Their seemingly sluggish nature may make them seemingly easy to predict,
            thus an opponent that you could take advantage of. However, enemies should still be wary of their presence
            on the battlefield, since their main role is to be able to take a few more hits, with some even hitting
            harder than other fellow Heroes.</p>

        <p>Given these characteristics, Heavies are great picks for defensive play in Dominion, holding key points on
            the field. They can choose to wander to help their dueling allies, but their slow speed risks wasted time as
            speedier enemies capture the Zones.</p>

        <p>Although this type of hero tends to be better-fitted for objective defense or tanking situations, they can
            excel in duels as well if they play with overall patience.</p>

                <h4>Heavy Heroes</h4>
                <li>Conqueror
                    <dl>The Conquerors, once criminals, now hired hands, wield their flail with brutality, swinging it
                        in unending succession. Even when on the defensive, they pay no heed to playing dirty as they
                        bash opponents with the face of their shield. While the flail may look like a fool's weapon, the
                        Conqueror reminds their foes that in the right hands, the flail is a vicious weapon that'll
                        punish those who are not ready for a good beating.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Black Prior
                    <dl>The Black Priors are agents of wolves who disappeared once Apollyon was defeated. Now, they have
                        returned to wreak new havoc on the battlefield. Their kite shield proves for them the best
                        defense and the best offense. Able to flip even the most shocking attacks overhead with their
                        Bulwark Counter, the Black Priors prove themselves to being gruesome Protectors with their
                        supportive Feats.

                </li>
                <li>Warlord
                    <dl>The Warlord, as their name denotes, are leaders among the Vikings, rightfully gained because of
                        their loyalty to their kin. With sword and shield, they are capable of harassing and
                        countering-attacking when they've properly waited out. Using their shield in conjunction with
                        their strikes, the Warlord keep themselves protected as they trade blows.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Jormungandr
                    <dl>The Jormungandr may be crazed cultists, but their strength and devotion should never be
                        underestimated. With the War Hammer in hand, which they believe the Great Serpent won from the
                        god of Thunder, these sectarians seek to cull the weak in anticipation of Ragnarok. They will
                        beat the breath out of you until exhaustion, testing if you can remain standing against them.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Shugoki
                    <dl>The Shugoki are the slowest among the Heavies in both attack and movement, but with their
                        Kanabo, they have the most devastating attacks to impart upon their foes. Core to the Shugoki is
                        their uninterruptable Heavy Attacks, which allow them to trade by taking advantage of how they
                        can charge and release their Heavy Attacks. They may be slow, but their mix-ups and ability to
                        shrug off attacks as they trade should not be underestimated.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Hitokiri
                    <dl>he Hitokiri are ghostly warriors, once executioners who'd seek out criminals, now they are
                        heartless murderers who kill anyone who step in the way of their Masakari Axe. They are
                        deserving of their title as "manslayers," as their fighting style bades well to aggressive
                        tactics that plants fear into the hearts of their opponents. Once they gain momentum in their
                        Mugen-ryu and for every head they behead, the Hitokiri become evermore the tyrant of the
                        battlefield's pace.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Jiang Jun
                    <dl>The Jiang Jun are generals among the Ancient Chinese armies, wise veterans who have mastered the
                        Guandao moon blade. They swing their weapon with great momentum and in large arcs, defending
                        against multiple enemies simultaneously. The Jiang Jun has their Sifu's Poise at their disposal,
                        which helps them rapidly regenerate Stamina, making it difficult to catch one in an exhausted
                        state.
