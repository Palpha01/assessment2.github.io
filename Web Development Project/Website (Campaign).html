        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <p>"Five years ago... the great warlords of the Iron Legion pushed the Vikings and the Samurai out of the lands
            of Ashfeld. We Knights stood proud and strong, and none dared defied us. Then, like a plague... peace fell
            on the land. The warlords faded from history, and the people have grew weak and complacent. When the Viking
            raids began anew, the Iron Legion was not prepared. Ashfeld plunged into chaos, yet the Vikings too seemed
            weak, only a shadow of what they've once been. And the Samurai have not left the Myre for years. Now... a
            new force has risen in Ashfeld: the Blackstone Legion. Knights, true warriors, ones who still understands
            between predator and prey. We have come to set the world back on it's proper course. This... will be the Age
            of Wolves." - Apollyon
        </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>Each Faction has their own campaign missions. They can be played as a single-player or in a 2 player co-op.
            It is a story that will initially help players learn how to play the chosen class in For Honor, but its main
            purpose is to tell a tale of the greatest warriors among the Vikings, Knights, and Samurai. A tale of
            warring factions deep in a crucial moment of an age-old war where they battle not only their faction enemies
            but the army of the merciless and bloodthirsty warlord Apollyon.</p>

        <p>Players will find themselves storming castles and fortresses in their dire attempt to turn the tide of
            battle. They will clean ranks of soldiers and officers alike with the help of Feats. They will confront
            deadly bosses in duels and become heroes of legend.</p>

                <p>The Warden is a courageous and talented young knight from the lands of the Iron Legion. Wardens are
                    expected to be noble and brave, living embodiments of virtue, and this one has the potential to be
                    that and more. But after years of fighting endless battles for no worthy cause, The Warden has begun
                    wandering, seeking a purpose equal to his talents and genuinely worth fighting for. That search
                    comes to end in Ashfeld, among the warriors of the Blackstone Legion.</p>

                <p>The Raider is a fearless but rage-filled warrior that is tired of watching their fellow Vikings spill

                    exception, but they are also filled with an immense love and pride for their people. Whether by
                    force, guile, or sheer determination, this fierce warrior intends to unite the Warborn clans. And

                    captivity. However, the Orochi's deep faithfulness and good spirit earned many loyal friends who are
                    keen on seeing their friend's honor restored-as soon as the small matter of springing the Champion
