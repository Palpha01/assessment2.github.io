        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div class="classimg"><img src="C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\For Honor\Assassins.png"
                alt="Assassins" width="900" height="400" /></div>

        <p>The Assassin is one of four playable types of Heroes in For Honor. They are swift and lethal, boasting
            evasive skills that compound well with their excellent offensive capabilities.</p>

        <p>At the cost of lacking defensive options compared to the other three types of Heroes (the Hybrids, the
            Heavies, and the Vanguards), the Assassins are quick to strike and are speedy on foot. When playing an
            Assassin, players should rely on their agility to evade attacks or use their signature Deflect to create an
            opening. They can utilize their speed to hunt down isolated enemies or assault distant control points.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>With the ability to seek-and-kill other Heroes effectively, Assassins possess a good selection of attacks
            that opens up many possibilities for follow-ups. While they lack durability and defensive options, their
            offense proves to make up for them. One striking difference between the Assassins and their brethren is that
            they cannot hold their blocking stance in one direction for long, as they are restricted to using a Reflex
            guard. In trade, using their evasive assets such as their Deflect reward well with worthwhile
            counter-attacks.</p>

        <p>In Dominion, Assassins cross the battlefield swiftly, taking Control Zones when the enemy is not attending
            to them. Their kit also work best when they headhunt, seeking lone foes who are on the retreat.</p>

        <p>Assassins can also deflect, which is possible by doing by pressing dodge in the direction of the attack at
            the right time. Every class has a different deflect, and they are very satisfying to accomplish.</p>

                <li>Peacekeepers
                    <dl>The Peacekeepers are the silent blade, entering and exiting battle, leaving only a trail of
                        death. Agile, they wield a sword and dagger, with which they get in close, cause their opponent
                        to bleed, before retreating as the enemy's health drains. Fret not any direct attack, as the
                        bleeding effects and their ability to get in and out of fights swiftly will leave you blindsided
                        to impending death.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Gladiators
                    <dl>The Gladiators are merciless warriors that fought in the stadium for entertainment and personal
                        glory. They fight much like a seasoned boxer, sailing the grounds like a butterfly and letting
                        their Trident sting like a bee. Although they feature a buckler in their off-hand, one should
                        not expect it to be used for defense, as the Gladiator is more than willing to use it to bash
                        their foe. Stay on your toes, as the Gladiator will try to sweep you off of your feet.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Berserker
                    <dl>The Berserkers are terrifying Viking beasts of war, with a brandished hand axe in each hand,
                        using their speed to find targets and their agility to stay alive with their harassing play
                        style. Their choice of weapon grants them the ability to chain together attacks in quick
                        succession, but their tenacity is what gives them the will to take hits to keep performing their
                        barrage.

                <li>Shaman
                    <dl>The Shaman lives a solitary life in the forests scattered around Valkenheim. This isolation has
                        left her with little to no civility, appearing as an utter savage. She sees omens and communes
                        with the gods, practicing rituals that only she understands. On the battlefield, the Shaman
                        fights to sate the thirst of her hatchet and dagger. And in her blood-rage will she ensure that
                        none will be left alive.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Orochi
                    <dl>The Orochi roam like ghostly snakes, slaughtering those unfortunate on the way with the katana.
                        Fighting like an assailant, they are given a balance between harassment and counter-attacking.
                        They strike swiftly and will mow you down with their stylish dodge cancels. Be wary when
                        encountering one of these warriors, as they will rush you down in a flurry of attacks.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Shinobi
                    <dl>The Shinobi were thought to be myths, but have come out of hiding, silent as they are deadly,
                        wielding a set of traditional Japanese kusarigama. They fight with a dancer's grace and kill
                        with precision thanks to a lifetime of disciplined training. Even mobile when in combat, the
                        Shinobi uses literal smoke and the fleet of foot to reposition themselves around their prey,
                        only to get up to close to pin you down with their signature Sickle Rain attack.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Nuxia
                    <dl>The Nuxia are trained bodyguards for nobles, but also are assassins who disguise their talents
                        through dance. Their capacity of graceful dancing makes them deadly when combined with the use
                        of the hook swords as they can lay traps within their combos, punishing enemies who play too
                        defensively.</dl>
