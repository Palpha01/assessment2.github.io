        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div class="classimg"><img src="C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\For Honor\Hybrids.png" alt="Hybrids"
                width="900" height="400" /></div>

        <p>The Hybrid is one of four playable types of Heroes in For Honor. They are most recognized for being a mixture
            between two of the other three types of Heroes (the Assassins, the Heavies and the Vanguards). They may be
            harder to understand to play due to their uncommon mechanics, but they are lethal in the hands of the player
            who takes the time to master them.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>Hybrids are called such as their skillset does not fit into only one of the three other Hero types: the
            aggressive yet fragile Assassin, the slow but steadfast Heavies, and the balanced and simple Vanguards.
            Therefore, they are better considered a mix of two of the three, or an augmented version of one of them. As
            a result though, no Hybrid are alike, even from the same Hybrid-mix. However, what is a common point is
            their complexity, where they aren't easy to learn and require time to understand. Once mastered, their
            skills allow them to reign terror upon the unprepared.</p>

        <p>It is best to understand the strengths of an individual Hybrid Hero, since their role is not as clear as the
            other Heroes. Some are deadly duelists, some are resilient keepers, and others are just unique pocket picks
            that cannot be described.</p>

                <h4>Hybrid Heroes</h4>
                <li>Lawbringer
                    <dl>The Lawbringers brandish the poleaxe, a weapon that is versatile in that it can slice, bash and
                        stab with designated parts of its construction. These knights are sturdy with heavy armor while
                        excelling in counter-attacking, keeping their foe off-balance by interweaving their offense with
                        obstructive shoves and throws.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Centurion
                    <dl>The Centurion served the Great Empire, and now serve the Knights on their conquest. Utilizing
                        the gladius, they unleash attacks from a close and personal distance. For this reason, the
                        Centurion does not mind getting up in their opponent's face to pack a nice punch or deliver a
                        knee to the gut to fell their foes.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Gryphon
                    <dl>The Gryphon, also known by his old name of Holden Cross, is a mercenary that has joined the
                        rebellion against the Order of Horkos, bringing with him the sharp polearm known as the
                        Bardiche. He has visited the many cultures of Heathmoor, learning moves from each faction to
                        combine them into a versatile fighting style. He supports his allies with his strong
                        teamfighting ability and an assortment of healing feats.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Valkyrie
                    <dl>The Valkyrie, chosen of the gods, are as versatile as they are complex. With a spear in one hand
                        and a shield in the other, the combination of both gives way to combo attacks, with some
                        surprises in the mix since an attack can come from either. They are excellent at pressing
                        enemies back and stalling their advances.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Highlander
                    <dl>The Highlander hail from the far north, fighting with the mighty claymore, the heaviest sword
                        ever made. The Highlander holds two deadly stances: a defensive stance which allows him to be a
                        resilient counter attacker, and an offensive stance which lets him unleash powerful swings and
                        blows on the enemy. Be careful when challenging this patient but ferocious foe.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Nobushi
                    <dl>The Nobushi may be like militia as they are from countryside villages, but they should not be
                        underestimated. Wielding the naginata, a polearm with a curved blade at its end, the Nobushi
                        have a range advantage, able to zone well along with having the opportunity to pester enemies
                        with a poke from a safe distance. Do not be naive to think a simple step back or aside will
                        bring you out of the danger of the Nobushi.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Aramusha
                    <dl>The Aramusha are Samurai who have fallen from grace, wielding a pair of blades. They are not
                        silent nor elegant but they move with the precision of a predatory cat and waste no movements.
                        Their dual blades make short work of any who stands before them, while their Blade Blockade
                        technique makes them indomitable even when outnumbered.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Kyoshin
                    <dl>The Kyoshin are warriors who have gone through ascetic training to hone their powers through
                        heart, mind and spirit. They wield the Shikomizue, using both blade and scabbard to mesmerize
                        their enemies with swift cuts and an almighty defense. Believing in equity and impermanence, the
                        Kyoshin carve their own path of destiny on the winds of change.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Shaolin
                    <dl>The Shaolin reigns from the Wu Lin faction, a warrior monk who keeps the prayers of his temple
                        close to him. Although his staff may be plain, his athleticism, unique martial arts and his
                        signature Qi Stance all offer a multitude of attack methods that will boggle inexperienced foes.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Zhanhu
                    <dl>The Zhanhu are masters of artillery of the Wu Lin, on top of being skilled enforcers. The long
                        Changdao they wield is one with their body as they dodge around their foe, outmaneuvering them.
                        They strike swiftly and with a fire that will smother the wisp of all who stand before them.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Pirate
                    <dl>The Pirates are seafaring captains, hailing from a faraway land as they bring both a jolly
                        attitude and a thirst for treasure to Heathmoor. They wield a Cutlass in one hand and a
                        Flintlock pistol in the other, using them both intermittently to destroy their foes in a flurry
                        of aggressive attacks. They are loyal to no one but their own kin... and to anyone who is
                        willing to pay them a fine price.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Medjay
                    <dl>The Medjay have traveled across the lands as noble warriors of the desert, preserving their
                        culture while offering salvatation. While they wield what looks to be a simple staff with fan
                        axes at each end, they have modified their traditional weapon so that it can split into twin
                        axes for a more ferocious combat style. Don't dare underestimate these warriors whose lineage
                        once served pharaohs.
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>Afeera
                    <dl>The Afeera are elite warrior scholars who were tasked with protecting not only the Sultanate,
                        but also the Celestial Sphere. Trained from a very young age, these agile warriors speed around
                        the battlefield, swinging their mace and shield like a twin pair of weapons. Wishing to no more
                        stand aside, the Afeera wish to take a more proactive role in enforcing the will of fate in
                        Heathmoor.
