        <h2>"We all die, some live forever."</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <div class="classimg"><img src="C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\For Honor\Vanguards.png"
                alt="Vanguards" width="900" height="400" /></div>

        <p>The Vanguard is one of four playable types of Heroes in For Honor. Wielding what could be called the symbol
            of their faction, they are well-balanced warriors with good attack and defense capabilities.</p>

        <p>While not as tanky as the Heavies, as fast as the Assassins, or as difficult to pick up as the Hybrids, the
            Vanguard's jack-of-all-trades nature grants them the flexibility to put themselves on equal grounds against
            the more specialized Hero type. When together with allies, they can fulfill a multitude of roles including
            offensive, defensive, and disruption when the time calls for them to adapt.</p>

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        <p>Most well-rounded of all types, the Vanguards are fittingly leaders of their faction. While they don't excel
            at any specific role, their versatile kit allows them to stem into any role throughout battle. They are also
            meant to be beginner-friendly, thus will not rely on anything too complex or overwhelming to be an adequate
            combatant. However, this does not mean they are ill-suited for advanced play, as they do have advanced move
            sets that allow them to remain viable when used by seasoned players.</p>

        <p>Vanguards perform well in Dominion due to their efficiency in all key aspects of the mode: killing soldiers
            on the front line, dueling enemy heroes, and capturing/defending zones.</p>

            <div class="classlist">
                <h4>Vanguard Heroes</h4>
                <li>Warden
                    <dl>The Wardens are the embodiment of the noble knights, wielding their impressive Longsword which
                        offers a balance between offense and defense. Together with swift sword strikes, the Warden will
                        charge forward with their shoulder to knock unsuspecting enemies off-balance.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Warmonger
                    <dl>The Warmongers are vicious wolves clad in full plate armor, grandiose in how they wield the
                        Flamberge sword. Fighting in the same image as who they worship, Apollyon, they also bring with
                        them a special power called Corruption that helps them isolate their target unless they wish to
                        die with their friends.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Raider
                    <dl>The Raiders embody the spirit of the Vikings as they wade into battle with their great Dane axe.
                        When they swing their axe at full force, they will either plow their axe head through their
                        opponents or shrug off incoming attack to land their strike. Above all, their throw is the most
                        impressive among all Heroes, carrying their foe on their shoulder over long distances.</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Kensei
                    <dl>The Kensei are the living incarnation of the Bushidō, the samurai way of the warrior. Armed with
                        the long Nodachi and a splendid set of armor from their homeland, the Kensei fight patiently,
                        striking with powerful and precise strikes worthy of their name of "sword saint."</dl>
                </li>
                <li>Tiandi
                    <dl>The Tiandi are loyal protectors to Kings, Queens, and Emperors, thus are face of their faction's
                        military might. Masters of the Dao blade, their weapon of choice, the Tiandi gracefully dance as
                        they cut up their opponents, while uniquely fighting best when their health is low.</dl>
